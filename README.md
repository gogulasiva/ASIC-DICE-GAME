**ASIC Dice Game Design & Optimization**  
- Developed an ASIC implementation of a dice game up to low-power synthesis.  
- Completed logic synthesis, low-power synthesis, and physical synthesis.  
- Analyzed hold violations in Static Timing Analysis (STA).  
- Used GUI-based buffer insertion for timing optimization.
