You can summarize this for your resume as:

**ASIC Dice Game Design & Optimization**  
- Developed an ASIC implementation of a dice game from netlist to physical design.  
- Completed logic synthesis, low-power synthesis, and physical synthesis.  
- Performed Static Timing Analysis (STA) to identify and resolve hold violations.  
- Utilized GUI-based buffer insertion for timing optimization.
